          By using the Apps, you agree to the collection and use of information as described there.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, we may access location data to provide weather and travel information and
          use third-party services, such as Google AdMob, for advertising and analytics.
          We do not collect user accounts, names, or similar identifying information directly.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fs-5">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Apps rely on third-party services and APIs, which may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Weather and mapping providers (such as NOAA, OpenWeather, MapTiler, or others);</li>

          of these third parties. Your use of their services is subject to their own terms and policies.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fs-5">5. No Warranty</h2>
        <p>
          The Apps are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranties of any kind,
          whether express or implied.
        </p>
        <p>
